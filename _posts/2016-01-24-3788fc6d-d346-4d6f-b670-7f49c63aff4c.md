We can add . . . a special touch to a variety of
events...Our repertoire of songs is very versatile - from the soft standards of
yesterday to to the classic rock of the 50-80's. We also play some of the old country classics that you seldom here anymore.
Whatever your needs, Cool Rush will be able to handle that special occasion. We
can add a sax player to the mix as well upon request. We take pride that Cool
Rush is part of a very select group of local bands capable of performing in any
environment. We attribute this to the professionalism, dedication, and hard
work of each individual member. Our mission statement is one word -
entertainment. This sums up the total philosophy of Cool Rush!
